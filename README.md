# DRONE_PROJECT



Description
This repository contains the complete design, code, and documentation for an IoT and AI-enabled Rescue Drone prototype. The system is designed to assist rescue teams during natural disasters by providing a fast, low-cost aerial response for detecting stranded individuals and transmitting their real-time GPS coordinates.

🛠 Project Overview
The drone integrates autonomous navigation, computer vision, and embedded electronics to achieve effective real-time monitoring. The system utilizes a Raspberry Pi for on-board processing and a YOLO-based image processing pipeline to identify persons in distress.

📂 Repository Structure

CAD-DESIGN: 3D design files (Fusion 360/SolidWorks) for the F450 frame layout and the custom micro-servo gripper mechanism.


🛰 Key Features

Real-Time Detection: AI-driven person detection using a Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2.


Autonomous Navigation: GPS-based waypoint following and real-time coordinate transmission via IoT wireless communication.

Mechanical Interaction: Integrated micro-servo gripper for pick-and-drop operations during low-altitude flight.

Low-Cost Architecture: Built on a quadcopter framework.
